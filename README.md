# Neural Network Java Implementation

This is java implementation of neural network, which
is able to add arbitrary number of layer
and each layer can have different activation functions(sigmoid, hyper tangent, relu ...)
and is able to adjust cost function(cross entropy(not yet implemented), square error)

This code was made to try various combinations of cost function and activation to see different behavior of neural network.
